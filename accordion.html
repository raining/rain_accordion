               Some of the notable features of Tucson are as follows:

               <ul>
                  <li>Vehicle Dynamic Control: improves the safety of a vehicle's stability by detecting and minimizing skids</li>
                  <li>Downhill Brake Control and Hillstart Assist Control: DBC allows the vehicle to maintain a safe speed on steep declines without having to use the brakes while HAC helps the vehicle maintain its position on a steep or slippery hill without rolling backwards.</li>
                  <li>Emergency Stop Signal: In the event of a panic stop, this feature automatically triggers the emergency hazard lights whose flashing alerts the driver behind thus reducing the risk of rear-end crashes.</li>
                  <li>Panoramic Sunroof</li>
                  <li>Proximity Key</li>
               </ul>

               Volkswagen Tiguan is a compact crossover vehicle (CUV) manufactured by German
               automaker Volkswagen using the PQ35 platform of the Volkswagen Golf. All Tiguans feature two-row seating and four-cylinder engines.

               The Tiguan debuted as a concept vehicle at the November 2006 Los Angeles International
               Auto Show and in production form at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show.
               Manufacture began in the winter of 2007 at Volkswagen's 2001-2009 subsidiary Auto 5000
               (an experimental company-within-a-company) in Wolfsburg and continued subsequently under
               the company's standard contract arrangements, at Wolfsburg and in Kaluga, Russia.
