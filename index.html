            Some of the notable features of Tucson are as follows:

            <ul>
                <li>Vehicle Dynamic Control: improves the safety of a vehicle's stability by detecting and minimizing skids</li>
                <li>Downhill Brake Control and Hillstart Assist Control: DBC allows the vehicle to maintain a safe speed on steep declines without having to use the brakes while HAC helps the vehicle maintain its position on a steep or slippery hill without rolling backwards.</li>
                <li>Emergency Stop Signal: In the event of a panic stop, this feature automatically triggers the emergency hazard lights whose flashing alerts the driver behind thus reducing the risk of rear-end crashes.</li>
                <li>Panoramic Sunroof</li>
                <li>Proximity Key</li>
            </ul>
